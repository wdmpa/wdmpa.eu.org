# WDMPA

This is the World Developer Emotion Protection Association. We are concerned about the happiness of developers. In the information age, developers are important providers of productivity; if developers are unhappy, social productivity will be weakened. We combat the factors that make developers unhappy, to protect their mood.

For example, search engine results are mixed with a large number of spam sites, and we are working hard to provide a list so that developers can use plug-ins such as uBlackList to block them.
